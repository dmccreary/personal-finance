It was, in his words, \"a complete flop.\"</p> <p>But Jack knew something everyone else didn't: most active fund managers (the people paid to pick stocks) couldn't consistently beat the market average.

If the stock market returned 10% on average, and active managers charged 2% in fees, their investors would only get 8%. But if Jack's index fund charged just 0.2% in fees, his investors would get 9.8%. Over decades, this small difference would add up to HUGE amounts of money.</p> <p>Jack's other secret weapon? He structured Vanguard unlike any other investment company. Instead of being owned by outside shareholders demanding profits, Vanguard was owned by the funds themselves\u2014which meant it was essentially owned by its investors.
