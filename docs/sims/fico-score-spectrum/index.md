## About This MicroSim

This visualization displays the FICO credit score spectrum, the most widely used credit scoring system in the United States. The spectrum ranges from 300 to 850, with color-coded categories showing:

- **Poor (300-579)**: High risk, may have difficulty getting credit
- **Fair (580-669)**: Below average, higher interest rates likely
- **Good (670-739)**: Average, acceptable to most lenders
- **Very Good (740-799)**: Above average, better than most consumers
- **Exceptional (800-850)**: Excellent, best rates and terms available
