## About this MicroSim

This MicroSim teaches how compound interest works. Students can adjust the principal amount, interest rate, and time period to see how their savings grow exponentially over time. The visualization shows the dramatic difference between simple and compound interest.

## How to Use

1. Adjust the **Principal** slider to set your starting amount
2. Set the **Interest Rate** to see different growth scenarios
3. Modify the **Time Period** to see long-term vs short-term growth
4. Watch the graph update in real-time as you adjust parameters

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objectives

After completing this activity, students will be able to:

1. **Understand** the difference between simple and compound interest
2. **Calculate** future value using the compound interest formula
3. **Analyze** how small changes in rate or time dramatically affect growth
4. **Apply** the Rule of 72 to estimate doubling time

### Target Audience

High school students learning about savings and investing.

### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of percentages
- Familiarity with exponents

### Activities

1. **Exploration**: Find the combination that doubles $1,000 in 10 years
2. **Comparison**: Compare growth at 3%, 5%, and 7% over 30 years
3. **Application**: Calculate what $100/month saved now would grow to by retirement

### Assessment

- Explain why starting early matters so much for savings
- Calculate the future value of $5,000 at 6% for 20 years
- Describe the "snowball effect" of compound interest
