## Overview

This visualization demonstrates how simple awareness and smart banking habits can save students hundreds of dollars each year. By comparing three different user types, students can see the dramatic impact of their banking choices:

- **Fee-Aware Banker**: Pays minimal fees ($10/year) through careful account selection and behavior
- **Average User**: Pays moderate fees ($280/year) due to lack of awareness
- **Fee-Heavy User**: Pays substantial fees ($694/year) through poor planning and expensive account choices

The difference of nearly $700 annually between fee-aware and fee-heavy banking represents 2-3 months of rent for many students, or could cover textbooks, groceries, or emergency savings.

## Fee Categories Explained

### Monthly Maintenance Fees

These are recurring charges banks impose for account ownership. Many banks waive these fees if you:

- Maintain a minimum daily balance (often $500-$1,500)
- Set up direct deposit
- Are a student (ask about student accounts)
- Choose online-only banks that don't charge monthly fees

**Cost range**: $0-$144/year

### Overdraft Fees

Charged when you spend more than your account balance. Typically $35 per occurrence.

**Prevention strategies**:
- Set up low balance alerts on your mobile app
- Link savings account for overdraft protection
- Opt out of overdraft coverage for debit purchases
- Track your balance daily

**Cost range**: $0-$280/year

### ATM Fees

Occur when using out-of-network ATMs. You pay twice: once to the ATM owner ($2-$4) and once to your bank ($2-$4).

**Avoidance strategies**:
- Use only in-network ATMs (find them with your bank's app)
- Get cash back at grocery stores
- Plan ahead for cash needs
- Consider banks with ATM fee reimbursement

**Cost range**: $0-$180/year

### Other Fees

Miscellaneous charges for services like:
- Paper statements ($2-$3/month)
- Wire transfers ($15-$30 each)
- Stop payment orders ($30-$35 each)
- Replacement debit cards ($5-$10)
- Certified checks ($10-$15)

**Avoidance strategies**:
- Switch to electronic statements
- Use mobile payment apps instead of wire transfers
- Avoid losing your debit card
- Use regular checks or money orders instead of certified checks

**Cost range**: $10-$70/year

## 🎯 Take Action Today

Ready to reduce your banking fees? Follow these concrete steps:

1. **Review your last 3 bank statements** - Add up all fees you've paid. Are you surprised by the total?

2. **Set up account alerts** - Get notified when your balance drops below a certain amount. Most banks offer this free through their mobile app.

3. **Find in-network ATMs** - Use your bank's ATM locator app or website. Plan your cash withdrawals around these locations.

4. **Switch to e-statements** - Save trees and money. Electronic statements are usually free, while paper statements can cost $2-3/month.

5. **Research no-fee accounts** - Many online banks (Ally, Capital One 360, Discover) have zero monthly fees and reimburse ATM fees.

6. **Link accounts for overdraft protection** - Connect your savings account to checking so transfers happen automatically instead of overdrafting.

7. **Opt out of overdraft "protection"** - Tell your bank you'd rather have transactions declined than overdraft. This prevents $35 fees on small purchases.

8. **Track your balance daily** - Use your bank's mobile app. Make it a habit to check every morning.

## Customization Guide

### Changing the Data

To modify the fee amounts, edit the `data` object in `main.html`:

```javascript
const data = {
    labels: ['Fee-Aware Banker', 'Average User', 'Fee-Heavy User'],
    datasets: [
        {
            label: 'Monthly Maintenance Fees',
            data: [0, 120, 144],  // Annual amounts for each user type
            backgroundColor: 'rgba(54, 162, 235, 0.8)',
        },
        // ... more datasets
    ]
};
```

### Adjusting Colors

Customize the color scheme by modifying the `backgroundColor` and `borderColor` properties in each dataset:

```javascript
{
    label: 'Overdraft Fees',
    data: [0, 70, 280],
    backgroundColor: 'rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.8)',  // Change this
    borderColor: 'rgb(255, 99, 132)',             // And this
    borderWidth: 1
}
```

### Modifying Tooltips

Update the avoidance tips shown in tooltips by editing the `feeAvoidanceTips` object:

```javascript
const feeAvoidanceTips = {
    'Monthly Maintenance Fees': {
        'Fee-Aware Banker': 'Your custom tip here',
        'Average User': 'Your custom tip here',
        'Fee-Heavy User': 'Your custom tip here'
    },
    // ... more fee categories
};
```

### Chart Options

Adjust chart behavior in the `options` object:

```javascript
options: {
    responsive: true,
    maintainAspectRatio: true,
    aspectRatio: 1.5,  // Width:height ratio
    scales: {
        y: {
            stacked: true,
            max: 800,  // Maximum Y-axis value
            title: {
                text: 'Total Annual Fees ($)'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Adding More User Types

To add additional user types (e.g., "Super Saver"):

1. Add the label to the `labels` array
2. Add corresponding data values to each dataset's `data` array
3. Add tooltip tips for the new user type in `feeAvoidanceTips`

```javascript
labels: ['Fee-Aware Banker', 'Average User', 'Fee-Heavy User', 'Super Saver'],
datasets: [
    {
        label: 'Monthly Maintenance Fees',
        data: [0, 120, 144, 0],  // Added value for Super Saver
        // ...
    }
]
```
