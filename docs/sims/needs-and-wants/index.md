## Description

The Needs vs Wants MicroSim is an interactive educational game that helps students develop critical financial literacy skills by practicing the categorization of expenses. Through this game-based learning experience, students work through 30 different expense scenarios, clicking buttons to identify each as a "Need," a "Want," or "It Depends" on context.

This MicroSim addresses one of the foundational concepts in personal finance: understanding the difference between essential expenses that are necessary for survival and well-being (needs) versus discretionary expenses that enhance quality of life but aren't strictly necessary (wants). Making this distinction is crucial for effective budgeting, financial planning, and achieving financial goals.

### Key Features

- **30 Expense Scenarios**: Students categorize a variety of realistic expenses including rent, subscriptions, groceries, insurance, and entertainment
- **Three-Category System**: Expenses are categorized as Needs (green), Wants (blue), or It Depends (yellow) for context-dependent items
- **Immediate Feedback**: Students receive instant feedback on each answer with explanations
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual score display shows current progress (X out of Y correct)
- **Educational Insights**: Each expense includes an explanation of why it's categorized that way
- **Context Awareness**: Some expenses are intentionally ambiguous to teach that context matters (e.g., a car payment might be a need if required for work, but a want if public transportation is available)
- **Final Score Summary**: Personalized feedback based on performance percentage

### Learning Objectives (Bloom's Taxonomy)

This MicroSim addresses multiple cognitive levels:

- **Remembering**: Recall the definitions of needs vs wants
- **Understanding**: Explain the difference between essential and discretionary expenses
- **Applying**: Categorize real-world expenses correctly
- **Analyzing**: Distinguish between clear-cut and context-dependent expenses
- **Evaluating**: Judge whether borderline expenses are truly necessary

## Lesson Plan

### Prerequisites

Students should understand:
- Basic financial vocabulary (expense, budget, income)
- The concept of limited resources requiring choices
- That people make trade-offs with their money

### Estimated Time

15-20 minutes for gameplay and discussion

### Learning Sequence

**1. Introduction (3 minutes)**
- Define "needs" as expenses essential for survival, safety, and basic well-being
- Define "wants" as expenses that enhance life but aren't strictly necessary
- Explain that context matters: the same expense might be different for different people

**2. Independent Practice (10 minutes)**
- Students play through the MicroSim individually or in pairs
- Encourage students to read the feedback explanations carefully
- Have students note any expenses they found surprising or disagreed with

**3. Class Discussion (5-7 minutes)**

Facilitate discussion around:
- Which expenses were easiest/hardest to categorize? Why?
- Which expenses surprised you?
- Can you think of situations where an expense might switch from want to need?
- How does the "cheaper alternative test" help? (If a cheaper option exists that meets the basic need, the expensive version is a want)

**4. Real-World Application**

Ask students to:
- List 5 of their own monthly expenses
- Categorize each as need or want
- Identify one "want" they could reduce or eliminate to free up money for savings

### Discussion Questions

1. **Critical Thinking**: "Is internet service a need or a want? How has this changed over time?"
   - *Teaching point*: Needs can evolve with society and technology

2. **Context Matters**: "When might a gym membership be a need instead of a want?"
   - *Teaching point*: Physical therapy, doctor-recommended exercise, professional athletes

3. **The Gray Area**: "What about 'emergency fund contribution'? Is saving a need or want?"
   - *Teaching point*: Financial security is a need, making emergency fund contributions essential

4. **Budget Impact**: "If someone spends 80% of their income on wants, what problems might they face?"
   - *Teaching point*: Insufficient funds for needs, no emergency savings, debt accumulation

### Assessment Opportunities

- **Formative**: Observe student performance score in the game (target: 75%+)
- **Discussion**: Listen for sophisticated reasoning about context-dependent expenses
- **Application**: Review students' categorization of their own expenses
- **Quiz Question**: "Explain why 'latest iPhone' is a want while 'phone bill' is a need"

### Extension Activities

**For Advanced Students**:
- Create a personal budget dividing expenses by needs/wants
- Research the 50/30/20 budgeting rule (50% needs, 30% wants, 20% savings)
- Analyze how needs/wants differ across income levels and cultures

**For Struggling Students**:
- Start with just the clear-cut examples
- Use the "cheaper alternative test": If a cheaper version exists, the expensive option is a want
- Create visual flashcards for common expenses

### Connection to Course Concepts

This MicroSim connects to:
- **Budgeting** (Chapter 3): Needs vs wants helps prioritize budget categories
- **Financial Goal Setting** (Chapter 1): Understanding wants helps identify areas to reduce spending
- **Opportunity Cost** (Chapter 1): Every want chosen means less money for needs or savings
- **Emergency Fund** (Chapter 3): Distinguishing needs helps calculate how large an emergency fund should be

### Tips for Effective Use

1. **Before Playing**: Define needs and wants clearly, give 2-3 examples of each
2. **During Play**: Encourage students to read explanations, not just try to get points
3. **After Playing**: Facilitate discussion about surprising or controversial items
4. **Follow-Up**: Have students track their own spending for a week and categorize each expense

### Common Student Misconceptions

- **"If I use it regularly, it's a need"**: Frequency doesn't determine necessity
  - *Example*: Daily coffee shop visits are still a want

- **"If I can't imagine life without it, it's a need"**: Emotional importance ≠ necessity
  - *Example*: Streaming services feel essential but aren't

- **"Needs and wants are the same for everyone"**: Context matters!
  - *Example*: Car ownership depends on available transportation alternatives

### Pedagogical Approach

This MicroSim uses game-based learning principles:
- **Immediate feedback** helps reinforce correct categorization
- **Progressive revelation** of explanations builds understanding
- **Score tracking** motivates engagement without high-stakes pressure
- **Context-dependent items** develop critical thinking skills
- **Realistic scenarios** connect to students' lived experiences

The three-category system (Need/Want/Depends) is pedagogically important because it:
- Acknowledges that personal finance isn't always black and white
- Develops analytical thinking about context
- Prevents oversimplification of complex financial decisions
- Teaches that individual circumstances matter in financial planning

### Academic Alignment

This MicroSim aligns with:
- **National Standards for Financial Literacy**: Standard I (Earning Income), Standard III (Saving)
- **Jump$tart Coalition**: Financial Responsibility and Decision Making
- **Council for Economic Education**: Personal Finance competency areas

### Accessibility Notes

- High contrast color scheme (green/blue/yellow) supports colorblind users
- Large text (28px for expense items) supports readability
- Click-based interaction (no drag-and-drop) supports various input methods
- Text-based feedback supports screen readers
