- Clean, gamified design to make learning fun

Educational insights:
- "Great job! Most people underestimate how many wants they have."
- "Tip: The 'cheaper alternative' test helps clarify needs vs wants"
- "Remember: Context matters. A car is a need if required for work, a want if you live on a bus line."
