## About This MicroSim

This visualization displays historical Treasury Bill (T-Bill) yields, showing how short-term government borrowing rates have changed over time. T-Bills are considered the safest investments available and serve as a benchmark for other interest rates in the economy.

## Key Concepts

- **Treasury Bills**: Short-term government securities with maturities of 4, 8, 13, 26, or 52 weeks
- **Yield**: The return an investor receives, expressed as an annual percentage
- **Risk-Free Rate**: T-Bills are considered risk-free since they're backed by the U.S. government
