Test your understanding of career planning and income concepts.

#### 1. When exploring career options, what should you look for at the intersection of?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Only what you enjoy
2. What you enjoy, what you're good at, what pays well, and what's in demand
3. Only what pays the most money
4. Whatever your parents recommend
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The best career choices balance what you enjoy (engagement and meaning), what you're good at (skills and talents), what pays well (adequate compensation for your goals), and what's in demand (job security and growth). Focusing only on passion ignores financial reality, while focusing only on money leads to burnout. Finding work at this intersection provides both fulfillment and financial security.

#### 2. Why does income potential vary significantly for the same job in different locations?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. It doesn't vary—all locations pay the same
2. Cost of living, local demand, and market conditions differ between locations
3. Only union jobs have location-based pay differences
4. Remote work has eliminated all location-based pay differences
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Income for the same job varies dramatically by location due to cost of living differences, local demand for skills, and regional market conditions. A software engineer might earn $150,000+ in San Francisco but $80,000 in a smaller city—but San Francisco's cost of living is also much higher. When comparing salaries, always consider cost of living and remote work opportunities that may allow you to earn high-market salaries while living in lower-cost areas.

#### 3. What are employee benefits worth as a percentage of salary?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 0-5%
2. 10-15%
3. 20-40%
4. 50-60%
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Employee benefits typically add 20-40% to the value of your compensation. Health insurance alone can be worth $5,000-$15,000 annually. Add retirement matching, paid time off, and other benefits, and the total value is substantial. When comparing job offers, always evaluate the complete compensation package—a $70,000 salary with excellent benefits can be worth more than $75,000 with poor benefits.

#### 4. You're comparing two job offers: Job A offers $70,000 with 6% 401(k) match and full health insurance. Job B offers $75,000 with no match and you pay $4,000/year for health insurance. Which has higher total compensation?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Job B because the salary is higher
2. Job A because total compensation is higher after accounting for benefits
3. They're exactly equal
4. Can't determine without more information
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Job A true value: $70,000 salary + $4,200 match (6% × $70k) + ~$8,000 health insurance value = ~$82,200. Job B true value: $75,000 - $4,000 health insurance cost = $71,000. Job A provides $11,200 more in total compensation despite the lower salary! This demonstrates why evaluating complete packages, not just base salary, is critical when comparing offers.

#### 5. What is a side hustle?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Your primary job
2. An additional income source outside your main employment
3. A retirement account
4. A type of investment
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. A side hustle is income earned outside your primary job—freelancing, gig work, tutoring, selling products, renting assets, etc. Side hustles provide financial security through diversified income streams, help accelerate financial goals, and allow you to test business ideas or develop new skills. Popular examples include freelance writing/coding, rideshare driving, tutoring, Etsy shops, and renting spare rooms on Airbnb.

#### 6. When should you negotiate a salary offer?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Never—you should just accept what's offered
2. Always negotiate new job offers
3. Only if you have another offer
4. Only if you're senior level
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. You should always negotiate new job offers—companies expect it and initial offers typically have room for negotiation. Most people never negotiate and leave thousands of dollars on the table. Average successful negotiation yields $5,000-$10,000 increase, which compounds over your career (raises are percentages of current salary). Even small increases now mean huge differences over decades. Negotiating professionally shows confidence and business sense.

#### 7. What's the best approach to starting a salary negotiation?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Demand the highest possible salary immediately
2. Express enthusiasm, state your desired range with justification based on research and your value
3. Threaten to decline the offer
4. Ask for double what they offered
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Effective salary negotiation starts with expressing genuine enthusiasm about the role, then stating your desired salary range with specific justification: "Based on my research of market rates and my [experience/skills], I was expecting $X-$Y range." Use data (salary research, comparable positions), not emotions. Be specific but flexible. Let them respond—silence is powerful. If they can't move on salary, negotiate other items like signing bonus, remote work, or PTO.

#### 8. Starting at $60,000 vs $65,000 with 5% annual raises, what's the approximate career difference over 40 years?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. $5,000 total
2. $200,000 total
3. $400,000 total
4. No difference over time
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. That $5,000 difference compounds dramatically over a career because raises are percentages of current salary. Starting at $60k leads to about $4.8 million total earnings over 40 years with 5% annual raises. Starting at $65k leads to about $5.2 million—approximately $400,000 more lifetime! This demonstrates why negotiating your starting salary and early career moves are so financially important. Small differences now create enormous differences over decades.

#### 9. What is professional development?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Creating a LinkedIn profile
2. Ongoing learning and skill-building to increase your value in the job market
3. Getting your first job
4. Retiring early
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Professional development is continuous learning and skill-building to stay relevant, increase your value, and advance your career. This includes formal education (degrees, certifications), on-the-job learning (new projects, mentorship), self-directed learning (reading, courses), and networking. Industries and technology change rapidly—yesterday's skills become obsolete. Employers value continuous learners, and developing in-demand skills protects against job loss and commands higher pay.

#### 10. If your employer offers $5,000 in tuition reimbursement annually, what should you do?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Ignore it since you already have a degree
2. Take advantage of it to pursue additional education or certifications
3. Only use it if you're planning to leave the company
4. Give it to a coworker
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Employer-sponsored professional development (tuition reimbursement, training budgets, conferences) is free career advancement—always take advantage of it! Use it to pursue advanced degrees, professional certifications, skill development, or industry training. This increases your value, earning potential, and job security at no cost to you. Many employers offer $5,000-$10,000 annually in tuition reimbursement—not using it means leaving money on the table for your career growth.
