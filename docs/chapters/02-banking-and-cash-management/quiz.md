#### 1. What is the primary difference between a bank and a credit union?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Banks are for-profit institutions; credit unions are not-for-profit member cooperatives
2. Banks offer checking accounts; credit unions do not
3. Credit unions charge higher fees than banks
4. Banks are insured by FDIC; credit unions have no insurance
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. Banks are for-profit corporations owned by shareholders, while credit unions are not-for-profit cooperatives owned by their members. This often results in credit unions offering better rates and lower fees. Option B is false—credit unions offer checking accounts. Option C is backwards—credit unions typically have lower fees. Option D is false—credit unions are insured by NCUA, which provides equivalent protection to FDIC.

#### 2. Which type of account typically offers the highest interest rate?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Traditional savings account at a large national bank
2. Checking account with minimum balance requirements
3. High-yield savings account at an online bank
4. Standard checking account with no fees
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. High-yield savings accounts, especially at online banks, typically offer the highest interest rates (currently 4-5% APY) because online banks have lower overhead costs. Traditional savings accounts (A) offer minimal interest (0.01-0.5%). Checking accounts (B and D) typically offer little to no interest.

    **Concept Tested:** High-Yield Savings Accounts

#### 3. What does FDIC insurance protect?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Your deposits up to $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank
2. All money in your account regardless of amount
3. Your investments in stocks and bonds
4. Your credit card balances and loans
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) insures deposits up to $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, per ownership category. This protects your money if the bank fails. Option B is incorrect—amounts over $250,000 aren't fully insured at a single institution. Option C is false—FDIC doesn't cover investments. Option D is backwards—FDIC protects deposits, not debts.

#### 4. You have a checking account with a $500 balance. You write checks for $200, $150, and $300. If your bank charges a $35 overdraft fee, what will your balance be after all transactions clear?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. -$150
2. -$185
3. $500
4. -$35
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Starting balance: $500. After $200 and $150 checks clear: $150 remains. The $300 check overdraws the account by $150 and triggers a $35 overdraft fee, resulting in -$185. Option A only accounts for the overdraft amount, not the fee. Option C incorrectly suggests no transactions processed. Option D only shows the overdraft fee amount.

#### 5. What is the main advantage of online banking over traditional branch banking?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Online banks never require identification verification
2. Online banks typically offer higher interest rates and lower fees
3. Online banks allow unlimited cash withdrawals
4. Online banks don't require internet access
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Online banks have lower operating costs (no physical branches), allowing them to offer better interest rates on savings and lower or no monthly fees. Option A is false—all banks require ID verification. Option C is misleading—online banks provide ATM access but not necessarily unlimited free withdrawals. Option D is contradictory—online banks require internet for account access.

#### 6. Which practice helps prevent overdraft fees?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>

2. Tracking your balance and all pending transactions
3. Never checking your account balance
4. Spending more than your available balance
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Tracking your balance and pending transactions helps you know exactly how much money you have available, preventing accidental overdrafts. This includes monitoring checks that haven't cleared, pending debit card transactions, and scheduled automatic payments. Options A, C, and D all describe behaviors that increase the risk of overdrafts.

4. Insurance that protects against fraud

4. To apply for a loan
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"

</div>

??? question "Show Answer"

Personal checks (A) take days to mail and clear. ACH transfers (B) take 1-3 business days. Mailing cash (D) is slow, risky, and not recommended.
