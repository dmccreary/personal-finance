#### 1. What is the difference between gross income and net income?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Gross income is your total earnings before deductions; net income is what you take home after deductions
2. Gross income and net income are the same thing
3. Net income is always higher than gross income
4. Gross income only includes salary, not bonuses
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. Gross income is your total earnings before any deductions (federal/state taxes, Social Security, Medicare, insurance premiums, retirement contributions). Net income (take-home pay) is what remains after all deductions. Understanding this difference is crucial for budgeting—you can only spend your net income. Options B, C, and D are incorrect.

#### 2. What is the purpose of Form W-4?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. To report your annual income to the IRS
2. To tell your employer how much tax to withhold from your paychecks
3. To claim a tax refund
4. To apply for government benefits
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Form W-4 tells your employer how much federal income tax to withhold from each paycheck based on your filing status, dependents, and other factors. Filling it out correctly helps you avoid owing money or receiving a large refund at tax time. Option A describes Form W-2. Option C describes filing a tax return. Option D is unrelated to W-4.

    **Concept Tested:** W-4 Form

#### 3. What is a tax deduction?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Money the government owes you
2. An amount that reduces your taxable income
3. A direct reduction of your tax bill dollar-for-dollar
4. A type of tax refund
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. A tax deduction reduces your taxable income, which indirectly reduces your tax bill. For example, if you're in the 22% tax bracket and have a $1,000 deduction, you save $220 in taxes (22% of $1,000). Option C describes a tax credit (direct reduction). Options A and D are incorrect definitions.

#### 4. Which provides greater tax savings: a $1,000 tax credit or a $1,000 tax deduction?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. They provide the same savings
2. A $1,000 tax credit provides greater savings
3. A $1,000 tax deduction provides greater savings
4. It depends on your age
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. A $1,000 tax credit reduces your tax bill by exactly $1,000. A $1,000 tax deduction only reduces your taxable income by $1,000, which saves you (tax rate × $1,000). If you're in the 22% bracket, a $1,000 deduction saves $220, while a $1,000 credit saves $1,000. Credits are more valuable than deductions.

#### 5. What is the standard deduction for 2024 (single filer)?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. $6,350
2. $13,850
3. $27,700
4. $50,000
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The standard deduction for single filers in 2024 is $13,850. Most taxpayers use the standard deduction rather than itemizing because it's simpler and often provides a larger deduction. Option A is an outdated amount. Option C is the married filing jointly amount. Option D is unrealistic.

#### 6. What taxes are part of FICA?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Federal income tax only
2. Social Security and Medicare taxes

</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. FICA (Federal Insurance Contributions Act) includes Social Security tax (6.2% up to wage limit) and Medicare tax (1.45% on all wages). Both you and your employer pay these amounts. Self-employed individuals pay both portions (15.3% total). Option A is a separate tax. Options C and D are not part of FICA.

1. December 31st
2. January 31st
3. April 15th
4. June 30th
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Federal tax returns are due April 15th each year (or the next business day if April 15th falls on a weekend or holiday). You can request a 6-month extension to file, but any taxes owed are still due April 15th. Options A, B, and D are incorrect due dates.

#### 8. You earn $50,000 annually and are in the 22% tax bracket. How much will a $2,000 tax deduction save you?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. $2,000
2. $1,000
3. $440
4. $220
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. A tax deduction reduces your taxable income. The savings equals your tax rate multiplied by the deduction amount: 22% × $2,000 = $440. Option A would be correct for a tax credit (dollar-for-dollar reduction). Options B and D use incorrect percentages.

2. An account only available to wealthy people
3. An account with the highest interest rates
4. An account that eliminates all taxes permanently
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. Tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA, HSA, 529) provide special tax benefits—either tax-deductible contributions, tax-free growth, or tax-free withdrawals. These accounts help you save more effectively for retirement, healthcare, or education. Options B, C, and D are incorrect characterizations.

#### 10. What should you do if you expect to owe taxes when you file your return?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Don't file a return
2. Adjust your W-4 to increase withholding for next year and pay what you owe
3. Wait for the IRS to contact you
4. File a return but don't pay the taxes owed
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. If you owe taxes, file your return on time and pay what you owe (or set up a payment plan). Then adjust your W-4 to increase withholding so you don't owe next year. Option A and D can result in penalties and interest. Option C is reactive rather than proactive—file on time even if you owe money.
