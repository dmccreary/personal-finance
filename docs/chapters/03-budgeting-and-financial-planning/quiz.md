#### 1. According to the 50/30/20 budgeting rule, how should you allocate your after-tax income?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 50% savings, 30% needs, 20% wants
2. 50% needs, 30% wants, 20% savings and debt repayment
3. 50% wants, 30% savings, 20% needs
4. 50% debts, 30% savings, 20% spending
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The 50/30/20 rule recommends allocating 50% of after-tax income to needs (housing, food, utilities, insurance), 30% to wants (entertainment, dining out, hobbies), and 20% to savings and debt repayment beyond minimums. This provides a balanced approach to budgeting. The other options incorrectly order the categories or use wrong percentages.

#### 2. What is the primary purpose of an emergency fund?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. To save for vacation expenses
2. To cover unexpected expenses without going into debt
3. To invest in the stock market
4. To buy luxury items on sale
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. An emergency fund is money set aside in a readily accessible account (like high-yield savings) to cover unexpected expenses such as job loss, medical emergencies, or car repairs without needing to use credit cards or loans. Options A and D describe discretionary spending, not emergencies. Option C describes investing, not emergency savings.

#### 3. How much should you typically save in an emergency fund?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. $500 maximum
2. One month of income
3. 3-6 months of essential expenses
4. 10% of your annual salary
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Financial experts recommend saving 3-6 months of essential expenses (rent, food, utilities, insurance, minimum debt payments) in an emergency fund. This provides cushion for job loss or major unexpected expenses. Option A is too low. Option B doesn't account for extended unemployment. Option D uses income rather than expenses and provides inadequate coverage.

#### 4. In zero-based budgeting, what should happen to your income?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Half should remain unassigned for flexibility
2. Every dollar should be assigned a specific purpose before the month begins
3. Only expenses should be planned; income is tracked separately
4. At least 25% should be left unallocated
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Zero-based budgeting means giving every dollar a job before the month begins, so income minus all planned expenses and savings equals zero. This doesn't mean spending everything—savings and investments are assigned categories. Options A, C, and D misunderstand the concept of "zero-based," which refers to allocating all income, not leaving money unassigned.

#### 5. Which of the following is a "need" rather than a "want"?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Streaming service subscription
2. Basic groceries for cooking at home
3. Designer clothing
4. Vacation to Europe
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Basic groceries for home-cooked meals are a need—essential for survival and health. Streaming services (A), designer clothes beyond basic wardrobe (C), and vacations (D) are wants—they enhance quality of life but aren't essential for survival or maintaining employment.

#### 6. What is the "pay yourself first" principle?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Spending your paycheck on whatever you want immediately
2. Setting aside money for savings before paying any bills
3. Prioritizing savings and investments before spending on discretionary items
4. Paying yourself a salary if you're self-employed
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. "Pay yourself first" means prioritizing savings and investments by setting aside money for these goals before spending on discretionary items. Automate transfers to savings/investment accounts right when you get paid. Option A describes impulsive spending. Option B is too extreme—you must pay essential bills. Option D describes a different concept (self-employment compensation).

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. $300
2. $600
3. $900
4. $1,500
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Following the 50/30/20 rule, 20% of $3,000 = $600 should go to savings and debt repayment beyond minimum payments. This includes emergency fund contributions, retirement savings, and extra debt payments. Option A is only 10%. Option C is 30% (the wants category). Option D is 50% (the needs category).

#### 8. What is the primary benefit of automatic savings transfers?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. They eliminate the need for a budget
2. They make saving consistent and effortless by removing the decision-making
3. They provide higher interest rates than manual transfers
4. They are the only way banks allow you to save money
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Automatic transfers remove the temptation to spend money before saving it and eliminate the need to remember to transfer funds manually. This consistency helps build savings over time. Option A is false—you still need a budget. Option C is false—transfer method doesn't affect interest rates. Option D is false—manual transfers are always possible.

#### 9. Which expense is typically considered "variable"?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Monthly rent payment
2. Car insurance premium
3. Groceries and dining out
4. Student loan minimum payment
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Variable expenses change from month to month based on usage and choices. Groceries and dining out vary depending on your spending habits. Rent (A), insurance premiums (B), and loan payments (D) are fixed expenses—they're the same amount each month.

#### 10. What should you do if you consistently overspend your budget in a certain category?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Ignore it and hope it gets better
2. Stop tracking that category entirely
3. Analyze why you're overspending and adjust your budget or spending habits
4. Eliminate the category from your budget
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. When consistently overspending in a category, investigate the cause—is your budget unrealistic, or are you spending impulsively? Then either adjust the budget to reflect reality and reduce spending in other categories, or work on changing your spending behavior. Options A and B avoid the problem. Option D is impractical for necessary expense categories.
