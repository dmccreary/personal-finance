#### 1. What is the main difference between saving and investing?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Saving is for short-term goals with low risk; investing is for long-term goals with higher potential returns
2. Saving always earns more interest than investing
3. Investing is only for wealthy people; saving is for everyone
4. Saving and investing are the same thing
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. Saving typically involves low-risk accounts (savings accounts, CDs) for short-term goals and emergency funds. Investing involves buying assets (stocks, bonds, real estate) with higher potential returns but also higher risk, suitable for long-term goals like retirement. Option B is backwards—investments typically offer higher returns. Option C is false—anyone can invest. Option D is incorrect—they serve different purposes.

#### 2. What is diversification?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Investing all your money in one stock you believe in
2. Spreading investments across different assets to reduce risk
3. Only investing in bonds for safety
4. Timing the market to buy low and sell high
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Diversification means spreading investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds), sectors (technology, healthcare, energy), and geographic regions to reduce risk. If one investment performs poorly, others may perform well, balancing overall returns. Option A is the opposite of diversification. Options C and D don't capture the concept of spreading risk.

#### 3. Which investment typically has the highest long-term average return?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Savings accounts
2. Bonds
3. Stocks
4. Certificates of Deposit (CDs)
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Historically, stocks have averaged about 10% annual returns over the long term (decades), though with significant volatility. Bonds average 3-5%, savings accounts and CDs currently offer 4-5% but historically much lower. Higher returns come with higher risk—stocks can lose value in the short term, but time smooths out volatility.

#### 4. What is an index fund?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. A fund that tries to beat the market through active management
2. A fund that tracks a specific market index like the S&P 500
3. A high-risk investment in individual stocks
4. A type of savings account
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. An index fund is a mutual fund or ETF that tracks a specific market index (like the S&P 500 or total stock market) by owning all or a representative sample of the securities in that index. Index funds offer broad diversification, low fees, and typically outperform actively managed funds over time. Options A, C, and D describe different investment types.

#### 5. You invest $5,000 at 7% annual return. Using the Rule of 72, approximately how many years will it take to double your money?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 7 years
2. 10 years
3. 14 years
4. 20 years
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The Rule of 72 estimates doubling time by dividing 72 by the annual return percentage: 72 ÷ 7 = approximately 10.3 years. This quick mental math helps you understand the power of compound growth. The actual precise answer is 10.24 years, so option B is correct. Options A, C, and D don't follow the Rule of 72 formula.

    **Concept Tested:** Rule of 72

#### 6. What is dollar-cost averaging?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Trying to time the market by buying when prices are lowest
2. Investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals regardless of market conditions
3. Only buying stocks that cost less than $1 per share
4. Selling investments to lock in gains
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Dollar-cost averaging means investing a fixed amount regularly (like $200 every month) regardless of whether prices are high or low. When prices are high, you buy fewer shares; when low, you buy more. This averages out your purchase price over time and removes emotion from investing. This is what happens automatically with 401(k) contributions.

#### 7. Which statement about bonds is true?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Bonds are loans you make to companies or governments that pay you interest
2. Bonds are riskier than stocks
3. Bonds guarantee you will never lose money
4. Bonds always provide higher returns than stocks
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. When you buy a bond, you're lending money to a corporation or government entity. They pay you fixed interest (coupon payments) and return your principal at maturity. Option B is backwards—bonds are typically less risky than stocks. Option C is false—bonds can lose value if interest rates rise or if the issuer defaults. Option D is false—bonds typically offer lower returns than stocks.

#### 8. What is the relationship between risk and return in investing?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Higher risk investments typically offer higher potential returns
2. Lower risk investments always provide better returns
3. Risk and return are unrelated
4. All investments have the same risk-return profile
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. Generally, investments with higher risk (like stocks) offer higher potential returns to compensate investors for taking that risk. Lower-risk investments (like savings accounts and bonds) offer lower but more predictable returns. This risk-return tradeoff is fundamental to investing. Options B, C, and D contradict this established investment principle.

#### 9. For a young investor in their 20s with 40+ years until retirement, what asset allocation is typically recommended?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 100% bonds for safety
2. 80-90% stocks, 10-20% bonds for growth
3. 50% stocks, 50% cash
4. 100% cash in savings accounts
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Young investors have decades to recover from market downturns, so they can afford to take more risk for higher growth potential. An allocation of 80-90% stocks and 10-20% bonds is appropriate. Options A and D are too conservative and won't provide sufficient growth for retirement. Option C is overly cautious and leaves too much in cash earning minimal returns.

#### 10. What is the main advantage of investing in a Roth IRA over a taxable brokerage account?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Higher contribution limits
2. All growth and withdrawals in retirement are tax-free
3. No income limits for eligibility
4. You can withdraw contributions anytime without penalty even before retirement
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement—you never pay taxes on investment gains. Taxable accounts require you to pay capital gains taxes on profits. Option A is false—Roth IRAs have lower limits ($7,000/year) than taxable accounts (unlimited). Option C is false—Roth IRAs have income limits. Option D is true but is a secondary benefit, not the main advantage.
