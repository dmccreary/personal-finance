#### 1. What is the definition of net worth?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The total amount of money you earn each year
2. The difference between your assets and liabilities
3. The value of your retirement accounts only
4. Your monthly income minus expenses
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Net worth is calculated as Assets - Liabilities = Net Worth. It represents the total value of everything you own (assets) minus everything you owe (liabilities). Option A describes annual income, not net worth. Option C only considers retirement accounts, not all assets. Option D describes monthly cash flow, not net worth.

#### 2. Which best explains the concept of opportunity cost?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The price you pay when buying something on sale
2. The value of the next best alternative you give up when making a decision
3. The interest you earn on a savings account
4. The cost of borrowing money from a bank
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative you forgo when making a choice. For example, if you spend $1,000 on a vacation, the opportunity cost might be the investment returns you could have earned or debt you could have paid off. Option A describes discounts, option C describes interest earnings, and option D describes borrowing costs—none of these capture the concept of foregone alternatives.

#### 3. What does the time value of money principle state?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Money loses value during economic recessions
2. A dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future
3. Saving money always guarantees wealth
4. All investments provide the same returns over time
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The time value of money principle states that money available now is worth more than the same amount in the future because of its earning potential. A dollar today can be invested to grow, making it more valuable than receiving the same dollar later. Option A refers to economic cycles, not time value. Options C and D are false statements about saving and investing.

    **Concept Tested:** Time Value of Money

#### 4. A SMART financial goal must include which of the following characteristics?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Secret, Meaningful, Achievable, Rare, Timely
2. Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound
3. Simple, Monetary, Aggressive, Realistic, Temporary
4. Strategic, Moderate, Accountable, Rewarding, Tangible
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. SMART goals are Specific (clear and well-defined), Measurable (quantifiable), Achievable (realistic given your resources), Relevant (aligned with your values and priorities), and Time-bound (with a specific deadline). This framework helps create effective goals. Options A, C, and D use incorrect acronym definitions that don't represent the established SMART goal framework.

#### 5. If you have $10,000 in savings, a car worth $8,000, student loans of $15,000, and a credit card balance of $2,000, what is your net worth?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. $1,000
2. $18,000
3. -$7,000
4. $25,000
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. Calculate net worth as: Assets ($10,000 savings + $8,000 car = $18,000) minus Liabilities ($15,000 student loans + $2,000 credit card = $17,000) equals $1,000. Option B only adds assets without subtracting liabilities. Option C incorrectly calculates the difference. Option D adds all numbers together regardless of whether they're assets or liabilities.

#### 6. Which statement best describes the difference between assets and liabilities?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Assets are things you own that have value; liabilities are debts you owe
2. Assets decrease over time; liabilities increase over time
3. Assets are always cash; liabilities are always loans
4. Assets and liabilities are two names for the same thing
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. Assets are things you own that have economic value (cash, investments, property, vehicles), while liabilities are financial obligations or debts you owe to others (loans, credit card balances, mortgages). Option B is incorrect because some assets appreciate and some liabilities decrease as you pay them down. Option C is too narrow—assets include more than cash and liabilities include more than loans. Option D is completely false.

#### 7. What is the primary purpose of tracking your personal cash flow?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. To impress friends with financial knowledge
2. To understand where your money comes from and where it goes
3. To avoid paying taxes on income
4. To qualify for more credit cards
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Tracking cash flow means monitoring income (money coming in) and expenses (money going out) to understand your spending patterns, identify areas for improvement, and ensure you're living within your means. This awareness is fundamental to financial management. Options A, C, and D are not legitimate purposes of cash flow tracking.

#### 8. Which scenario best demonstrates the concept of compound interest?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Earning interest on your initial deposit only
2. Earning interest on both your initial deposit and previously earned interest
3. Paying the same amount of interest each year
4. Receiving simple interest payments monthly
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Compound interest means you earn interest on both your original principal and on the interest that has already accumulated. This creates exponential growth over time—your money grows faster and faster. Option A describes simple interest, not compound interest. Options C and D don't accurately capture the compounding effect that makes money grow exponentially.

    **Concept Tested:** Compound Interest

#### 9. You want to save $10,000 for a down payment on a car in 2 years. This goal is already Specific, Measurable, and Relevant. What must you add to make it Time-bound?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Nothing—it's already time-bound with the 2-year timeframe
2. The exact date when you'll make the purchase
3. Monthly savings amount needed to reach the goal
4. The specific car model you want to buy
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. The goal is already time-bound because it specifies a clear deadline: "in 2 years." Time-bound means having a specific timeframe or deadline, which this goal has. Option B would add more specificity but isn't necessary for the goal to be time-bound. Option C relates to making the goal Achievable by creating an action plan. Option D adds more specificity but doesn't affect the time-bound characteristic.

#### 10. What is financial independence?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Having no debt of any kind
2. Earning enough passive income to cover living expenses without working
3. Owning a home outright with no mortgage
4. Having at least $1 million in savings
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Financial independence means having enough passive income (from investments, rental properties, businesses, etc.) to cover your living expenses without needing to work for money. You have the freedom to choose whether to work. Options A and C describe specific financial milestones but not overall financial independence. Option D suggests an arbitrary dollar amount, but financial independence depends on your expenses, not a fixed number.
