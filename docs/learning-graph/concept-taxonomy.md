## Notes

- Categories align with the 12-chapter course structure for pedagogical consistency
- Foundation concepts are prerequisite knowledge needed across multiple other categories
- Some overlap is natural (e.g., tax-advantaged retirement accounts bridge TAX and RET categories)
- The taxonomy supports filtering and visualizing the learning graph by topic area
- Color coding in the final visualization will use these categories to distinguish concept types
