# About This Course

## Why This Matters for You

Money stress is real, and it affects everything—your sleep, your relationships, your mental health, and your ability to focus on what really matters. The good news? Financial stress is preventable when you have the right knowledge and skills.

In 2024, Minnesota took a bold step forward by requiring personal finance education for all high school students. This isn't just another graduation requirement—it's a lifeline. A nationwide poll by the National Endowment for Financial Education found that **83% of U.S. adults** believe this education should be mandatory. They've learned the hard way, and now they want to protect you from making the same mistakes.

## The Real Cost of Not Knowing

Here's a sobering statistic: According to [Bankrate.com](https://www.bankrate.com/credit-cards/news/states-with-most-credit-card-debt/), the average Minnesota household carries about **$5,425 in credit card debt**. With average APRs around 19.87%, that means families are paying roughly **$2,000 per year** just in interest—money that could have gone toward a dream vacation, a car, college savings, or a down payment on a home.

But it's not just about dollars and cents. Financial stress is one of the leading causes of anxiety, relationship problems, and even physical health issues. When you don't understand how money works, every financial decision becomes a source of worry instead of confidence.

## Learning That Doesn't Feel Like Learning

This course is different. We've packed it with **17 interactive MicroSims**—hands-on simulations that let you experiment with real financial scenarios without real-world consequences. Want to see what happens if you take out a 72-month auto loan versus a 36-month loan? Play with the numbers. Curious about how compound interest can turn small savings into life-changing wealth? Watch it grow in real-time.

These aren't boring lectures or dry textbooks. This is financial education designed to be engaging, visual, and actually fun. You'll explore concepts through interactive tools that make abstract ideas concrete and memorable.

## What You'll Gain

By the end of this course, you'll have superpowers that most adults wish they'd learned decades ago:

- **Confidence** in making big financial decisions
- **Freedom** from anxiety about money
- **Control** over your financial future
- **Knowledge** to avoid expensive mistakes
- **Skills** to build real wealth over time

You'll know how to build excellent credit, create budgets that actually work, invest for your future, protect yourself from scams, negotiate salaries, and plan for major purchases. These skills will save you tens of thousands of dollars over your lifetime—maybe hundreds of thousands.

## For Teachers and Students Everywhere

While this course was created to meet Minnesota's new graduation requirement (students beginning grade 9 in 2024-2025 and beyond must complete personal finance in grades 10-12), the content is designed for anyone who wants to take control of their financial life. Whether you're in Minnesota or anywhere else, whether you're a student or a teacher looking for engaging material, this course is for you.

## Join the Movement

Financial literacy isn't just about personal success—it's about building stronger communities. When young people understand money, they make better decisions, experience less stress, support their families more effectively, and contribute to a healthier economy.

You're not just learning about money. You're learning how to reduce one of life's biggest sources of stress and anxiety. You're gaining tools for mental wellness and life success.

Let's make financial stress a thing of the past. Your future self will thank you.
